First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ‚ù§Ô∏è

- You can [email me](mailto://alighahremani1377@gmail.com) before doing anything else.
  - <alighahremani1377@gmail.com>
- Never do a pull request on master/main/stable branches. (do it on 'dev' branch)
- Before any commit
  - make sure you are passing all tests by running: 'make test'
  - make sure the code is formatted correctly by running 'make fmt'
    - you can config your text editor/IDE to run 'cargo fmt' file save event
  - make sure there is no clippy warning (optional)
- If you need to do a breaking change let me know before doing anything. (we will make a new branch for it and add that to next major update X.x.x)
